Schemas - Structured Data
=========================

A schema, or structured data, is a way of giving search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo! and Yandex meaning to your websites markup. Once the search engine has understood the pages content, it can then present it in a more attractive way:

With typical HTML markup, it's not always clear to search engines what the purpose of the page is. Structured data enables you to overcome this and make it easier for both search engines and the end user to find what they're looking for.
